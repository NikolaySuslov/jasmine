Live version: [codefrau.github.io/jasmine](https://codefrau.github.io/jasmine/)

This is a version of Croquet Jasmine running on the [SqueakJS](https://squeak.js.org) virtual machine. Here is an [early demo of the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXGLOiZUZ2U) from 2003. Alan Kay used it for his [Turing Award lecture in 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXC19T5sJ1U&t=994s).

This is work-in-progress. Contributions are very welcome.

If you have an idea why the materials are so dark, and the textures so bright, please let me know. For color reference, there is this [Flickr album by David Smith](https://www.flickr.com/photos/87951975@N00/with/5943753).
